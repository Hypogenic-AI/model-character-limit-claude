Papers downloaded: 7
Datasets downloaded: 3 (character_tracking_synthetic, bAbI tasks, narrativeqa_samples)
Repositories cloned: 3 (entity-tracking-lms, ruler-benchmark, lost-in-the-middle)

Summary:
- Comprehensive literature review covering entity/character tracking in LLMs
- Synthetic dataset created for controlled character count experiments (2-20 characters)
- bAbI tasks downloaded for baseline comparison
- Three relevant code repositories cloned for evaluation frameworks

The experiment runner can now proceed with:
1. Loading datasets/character_tracking_synthetic.json
2. Testing LLMs on varying character counts
3. Measuring accuracy degradation as character count increases
4. Comparing against bAbI Task 2 baseline

Key hypothesis to test:
"Given a new story, there is a limit to the number of different characters a language model can keep track of in-context."

Recommended experiment:
- Vary num_characters from 2 to 20
- Measure accuracy for each configuration
- Plot accuracy vs. number of characters
- Identify "breaking point" where accuracy drops significantly
