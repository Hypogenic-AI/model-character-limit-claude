The resource finding phase is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Resource Finding Complete

### Papers Downloaded (7)
| Paper | Key Contribution |
|-------|------------------|
| Entity Tracking in LMs (Kim & Schuster 2023) | First systematic entity tracking study |
| Lost in the Middle (Liu et al. 2024) | U-shaped context usage curve |
| RULER (Hsieh et al. 2024) | Variable tracking benchmark |
| NoCha (Karpinska et al. 2024) | Book-length comprehension evaluation |
| How Do LMs Track State? (Li et al. 2025) | Mechanistic analysis |
| Too Long, Didn't Model (2025) | Context failure analysis |
| CharacterBench (Zhou et al. 2024) | Character customization evaluation |

### Datasets Downloaded (3)
1. **character_tracking_synthetic.json** - Custom dataset with 90 examples systematically varying 2-20 characters
2. **bAbI Tasks** - Classic entity tracking benchmark (20 tasks)
3. **NarrativeQA samples** - Story QA reference examples

### Code Repositories Cloned (3)
1. **entity-tracking-lms** - Entity tracking experiments from Kim & Schuster
2. **ruler-benchmark** - NVIDIA's long-context evaluation framework
3. **lost-in-the-middle** - Position-based analysis code

### Key Documents Created
- `literature_review.md` - Comprehensive synthesis of all papers with recommendations
- `resources.md` - Complete catalog of all resources with usage instructions
- `datasets/README.md` - Dataset documentation with download instructions
- `code/README.md` - Code repository documentation
- `papers/README.md` - Paper catalog
- `.resource_finder_complete` - Completion marker

### Recommended Next Steps for Experiment Runner
1. Load `datasets/character_tracking_synthetic.json`
2. Test LLMs on stories with varying character counts (2-20)
3. Measure accuracy degradation as character count increases
4. Compare against bAbI Task 2 baseline
5. Identify the "breaking point" where model accuracy drops significantly
