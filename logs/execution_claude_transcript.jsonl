This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block, or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with .catch(). The promise rejected with the reason:

All files are in place. Let me do a final summary of what was accomplished:

## Research Session Complete

I have completed a full research session investigating **character tracking limits in language models**. Here's a summary:

### What Was Done

1. **Environment Setup**: Created isolated Python environment with uv and installed dependencies (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, openai, httpx)

2. **Resource Review**: Analyzed pre-gathered literature review and datasets covering entity tracking, long-context understanding, and character benchmarks

3. **Research Planning**: Created `planning.md` with detailed experimental design including hypotheses, methodology, and evaluation metrics

4. **Implementation**: Built experiment code (`src/experiment.py`) to:
   - Query GPT-4.1 and GPT-3.5-turbo via OpenAI API
   - Compute baselines (random, first-state)
   - Evaluate accuracy across character counts, question types, and action counts

5. **Experiments Run**: Tested both models on 90 synthetic stories with 2-20 characters, generating 2,295 predictions per model

6. **Analysis & Visualization**: Created 5 figures showing accuracy patterns, saved results to CSV/JSON

7. **Documentation**: Wrote comprehensive `REPORT.md` (15 pages) and `README.md`

### Key Findings

| Model | Accuracy | Character Limit Found? |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| GPT-4.1 | **99.95%** | No (perfect at 20 chars) |
| GPT-3.5-turbo | 81.4% | No degradation pattern |

**Surprising Result**: The hypothesis that models have a character tracking limit was **not supported**. GPT-4.1 essentially solves this task perfectly, even with 20 characters and 20 state changes.

### Files Created
- `REPORT.md` - Full research report
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `planning.md` - Research plan
- `src/experiment.py` - Experiment code
- `src/visualize.py` - Visualization code
- `results/raw_results.csv` - All predictions
- `results/analysis.json` - Statistics
- `results/figures/` - 5 visualization plots
