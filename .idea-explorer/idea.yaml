idea:
  title: How many characters can a model keep track of?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Given a new story, there is a limit to the number of different characters
    a language model can keep track of in-context. By identifying the point at which
    the model struggles, we can gain insight into the mechanisms it uses to track
    characters and their attributes.

    '
  background:
    description: "Some stories have a lot of characters\u2014think War and Peace or\
      \ the Tale of Genji. Given a new story, in-context, how many different characters\
      \ can a model keep track of? And can we use the points at which the model struggles\
      \ to help us figure out what mechanism it uses to keep track of different characters\
      \ and their attributes? How good are models at this anyway?"
